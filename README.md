Invasion from the Unknown
================================================================================

**Invasion from the Unknown** (**IftU**) is an add-on campaign for the
**[Battle for Wesnoth][1]**.

[1]: <https://www.wesnoth.org/>

Long after the Fall, the last forest elves on the Great Continent are forced to
abandon their secluded home and forge an unprecedented alliance in hopes of
retaliating against the great evil that has befallen Irdya. But even then, they
will require more than one ancient power to aid them in their quest...

**(Intermediate level, two episodes with 13 scenarios each.)**

**NOTE:** Some scenarios of this campaign work significantly different from
normal Wesnoth gameplay. It is especially important to pay close attention to
the mission objectives and not necessarily try to kill every single enemy,
especially on shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn
continuously.

Although not strictly required, players are advised to become familiar with the
stories, characters, and historical events presented in *Descent into Darkness*
and  *Under the Burning Suns* before playing this campaign.


Installing Invasion from the Unknown
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
 * Battle for Wesnoth 1.12.0 or later 1.12.x versions
 * *Invasion from the Unknown Music* add-on from the Wesnoth add-ons server
   (optional, includes additional music used throughout the campaign).

Released versions of IftU may be obtained from the Battle for Wesnoth add-ons
server using the game’s built-in client. Alternatively, players who know how to
use Git may clone the [main repository][2] on GitHub into Wesnoth’s
`<user data>/data/add-ons` directory. See [Where is my user data directory?][3]
in the Wesnoth.org wiki for information on locating your user data directory.

A game screen resolution of **800x600 or greater** is recommended. Some
sequences make use of floating labels, halos, and standing unit animations, so
you might want to make sure these options are enabled under
**Preferences** → **Display**.
